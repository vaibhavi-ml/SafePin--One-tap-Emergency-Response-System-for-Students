# SafePin--One-tap-Emergency-Response-System-for-Students

SafePin is a one-tap emergency response system designed for hostels and campuses.

## Problem
Emergency response in colleges are often delayed due to panic, poor location clarity, and manual communication.

## Solution
SafePin allows students to send SOS alerts with minimal interaction while automatically attaching accurate location and context.

## Key Features
- One-tap SOS
- GPS + DigiPIN fallback
- Hostel block auto-detection
- Multi-device readiness (wearables, keychain SOS)
- Real-time admin dashboard
- Nearby hospital & security routing

## Tech Stack
- React + Vite
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore, FCM)
- Node.js (API-ready backend)
- Google Maps integration

## DigiPIN Note
The official DigiPIN API is not public yet.  
SafePin is API-ready and uses a resolver that can be replaced once the official API is released.

Built during a 24-hour hackathon.
