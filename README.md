# SafePin--One-tap-Emergency-Response-System-for-Students

SafePin is a one-tap emergency response system designed for hostels and campuses.

## 🚨 Problem

## 💡 Solution
SafePin allows students to send SOS alerts with minimal interaction while automatically attaching accurate location and context.

## 🔑 Key Features
- One-tap SOS
- GPS + DigiPIN fallback
- Hostel block auto-detection
- Multi-device readiness (wearables, keychain SOS)
- Real-time admin dashboard
- Nearby hospital & security routing

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- React + Vite
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore, FCM)
- Node.js (API-ready backend)
- Google Maps integration

## ⚠️ DigiPIN Note
